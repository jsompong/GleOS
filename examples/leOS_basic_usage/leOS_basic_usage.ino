/*
This is a simple sketch to demonstrate the use of leOS, a
<l>ittle <e>mbedded <O>perating <S>ystem" 

leOS is not a complete OS nor an RTOS as you usually know but it's a simple
scheduler to schedule little works in background, so that you can forget about
them.

This sketch tests the use of 1 task that runs in background.
To try this sketch, create a circuit on a protoboard connecting 2 LEDs
(and their resistors) at Arduino pins 7, and 8.

More info on the schedulers and the methods can be found into the README file.
