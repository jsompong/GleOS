/*
This is a simple sketch to demonstrate the use of leOS, a
<l>ittle <e>mbedded <O>perating <S>ystem

leOS is not a complete OS nor an RTOS as you usually know but it's a simple
scheduler to schedule little works in background, so that you can forget about
them.

This sketch demonstrates the ability to modify a running tast varying the 
interval of a flashing LED.
Simply upload the sketch and look at the LED on pin 13.

More info on the schedulers and the methods can be found into the README file.
