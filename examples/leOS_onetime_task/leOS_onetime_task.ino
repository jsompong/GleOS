/*
This is a simple sketch to demonstrate the use of leOS, a
<l>ittle <e>mbedded <O>perating <S>ystem" 

leOS is not a complete OS nor an RTOS as you usually know but it's a simple
scheduler to schedule little works in background, so that you can forget about
them.

This sketch tests the use of one-time tasks. A one-time task is a task that has
to run only once after a specific interval. To try this sketch, create a circuit on a 
protoboard connecting 3 LEDs (and their resistors) at Arduino pins 7, 8, 
and 9. First, a one-time task will light on a LED, then another one-time task
will light it off.

More info on the schedulers and the methods can be found into the README file.
