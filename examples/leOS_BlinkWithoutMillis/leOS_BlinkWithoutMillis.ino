/*
This is a simple sketch to demonstrate the use of leOS, a
<l>ittle <e>mbedded <O>perating <S>ystem" 

leOS is not a complete OS nor an RTOS as you usually know but it's a simple
scheduler to schedule little works in background, so that you can forget about
them.

This sketch demonstrates the blink of 1 LED without using millis() nor delay().
Simply upload the sketch and look at the LED on pin 13.

More info on the schedulers and the methods can be found into the README file.
